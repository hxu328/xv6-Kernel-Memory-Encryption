# xv6-Kernel-Memory-Encryption
To simplify this project, we approximate the benefits of encryption by flipping all bits in a page (i.e., xor every bit with 1 or just use ~);  actually performing encryption would require more computation and recording a corresponding key, but those are not relevant to this project.
